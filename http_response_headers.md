# HTTP Response Headers

## Access-Control-Allow-Origin

Lists what domains can access this resource using CORS. This header would allow all sites:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

## Allow

Used with a `405 Method Not Allowed` response to a request with an invalid HTTP method. The value of this header lists what methods are allowed.

```
$ http --print=h POST www.google.com
HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
Allow: GET, HEAD
...
```

This header is not always returned with `405 Method Not Allowed` responses.

## Content-Length

The length of the response body in bytes.

```
Content-Length: 1984
```

## Content-Type

Describes the media type or format of the body. Common values include application/json and application/xml. For a fairly complete list of media types, see Wikipedia.

This field will often include a charset attribute as well:

```
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
```

## ETag

```
ETag: "6df23dc03f9b54cc"
```

Used to identify a specific version of a resource. Any changes to the resource will result in a new value for ETag.

The value returned in this header can be sent with future requests to the same URL in the If-None-Match header. If the resource has not changed, the provider will respond with 304 Not Modified. If the resource has changed, the response should include the entire resource in its updated state, along with a new ETag.

This scheme is used to avoid fetching and processing data that has not been updated since the last time it was accessed.

## Last-Modified

```
Last-Modified: Thu, 05 Jul 2012 15:31:30 GMT
```

The last time the requested resource was modified.

The date and time returned in this header can be sent with future requests to the same URL in the If-Modified-Since header. If the resource has not changed, the provider will respond with 304 Not Modified. If the resource has changed, the response should include the entire resource in its updated state, along with a new value for Last-Modified.

This scheme is used to avoid fetching and processing data that has not been updated since the last time it was accessed.

## WWW-Authenticate

Indicates what type of authentication is required to access a resource. A resource that required HTTP basic authentication would include a header like this:

```
WWW-Authenticate: Basic
```

## X-* Headers

Naming headers with names beginning with X- is a convention for headers that aren't standardized. These headers are often API or application-specific. GitHub uses some of these headers to provide the status of rate limiting with each request:

```
➜  api_book_content git:(master) ✗ http https://api.github.com/user
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
...
X-RateLimit-Limit: 60
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 57
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1413592144
...
```
